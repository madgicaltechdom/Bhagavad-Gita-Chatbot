Sharing knowledge and blessings with others brings reciprocal benefits. Like charity, spiritual knowledge increases when shared. Those who spread the Gita's wisdom receive the greatest blessings, as it attracts Krishna's special grace. This is because sharing good deeds, including knowledge, enhances our own understanding and blessings."}, {"chapter": 18, "verse": 69, "description": "Amongst all the gifts we can give to others, the gift of spiritual knowledge is one of the highest, because it has the capacity to transform the recipient eternally.

Guru Ashtavakra advised King Janak to repay his debt by sharing this knowledge with others who seek it. Similarly, Lord Krishna emphasized the importance of sharing the Bhagavad Gita's wisdom as the highest form of devotion. However, teachers should approach this task with humility, recognizing themselves as instruments of God's grace and giving credit to the divine source of the knowledge they impart.

This does not mean abandoning reason but rather using it to discern Krishna's will. By studying the Gita, we gain insight into Krishna's desires, allowing us to align our intellect with his purpose.\n\nTherefore, those who engage in the study of the Gita engage in a form of intellectual worship. They use their minds to understand Krishna's teachings and to align their actions with his will. This intellectual surrender is not a passive act but an active engagement with the divine, using our intellect to fulfill Krishna's purpose for us."}, {"chapter": 18, "verse": 71, "description": "Not everyone has the intellect to comprehend the deep imports of the dialogue between Shree Krishna and Arjun.

God resides within them and recognizes their sincere efforts. The story of Sananda, an illiterate disciple of Shankaracharya, exemplifies this. Despite his inability to comprehend the teachings, Sananda listened attentively with unwavering faith. One day, while washing his Guru's clothes, he was summoned by Shankaracharya, who acknowledged his faith and waited for his arrival before beginning the class. Miraculously, Sananda crossed the river on water, with lotus flowers blooming beneath his feet. As he approached his Guru, he spontaneously uttered verses in praise of him, earning the name \"Padmapada.\" This story demonstrates the transformative power of faith, as even those who may not fully understand the teachings can experience its benefits through sincere listening."}, {"chapter": 18, "verse": 72, "description": "Shree Krishna has taken the position of being Arjun\u2019s teacher.

He realized his duty and surrendered to God's will. This transformation was not solely due to Krishna's words but also his grace.\n\nSpiritual knowledge, unlike material knowledge, cannot be acquired through mere intellect or payment. It is bestowed through grace and received through faith and humility. Approaching the Gita with pride or seeking to evaluate its worthiness will hinder comprehension.\n\nNumerous commentaries and readers have engaged with the Gita over centuries, but few have achieved enlightenment like Arjun. To truly understand the Gita, one must not only read it but also cultivate faith and surrender to attract Krishna's grace.
